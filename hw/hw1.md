# Math 5620 Homework 1:

### Questions

The following questions should be completed.

<hr>

1. Write out the details for the accuracy analysis for

$$
  D_- f(\bar{x}) = \frac{f(\bar{x})-f(\bar{x}-h)}{h}
$$

Compute an expression for the error in terms of $h$ and a constant. What
restrictions must be satisfied in order to use this difference.?

<hr>

2. Write a code that returns the coefficients for a difference quotient
   approximating the first derivative of a function at a specified point
   $\bar{x}$ given an input array of points.

<hr>

3. Write a code that will return the coefficients of a derivative of a given 
   order specified at a minimal number of points specified by the user.

<hr>

4. Write a code that will determine the accuracy of a specified difference
quotient. That is, instead of computing the coefficients, input the
coefficients and determine the number of equations that should be satisfied.
