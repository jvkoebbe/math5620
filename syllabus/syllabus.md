The information in the table above can be used to contact your instructor. The
best way to reach your instructor is to send an email. If you need to make an
appointment to discuss content or anything else in the course send an
**[email](joe.koebbe@usu.edu)** with a couple of times and days that will fit
your schedule. It is best to meet face-to-face, but Zoom will also work.
Students should expect to make appointments throughout the semester and will be
required as part of the homework assignments. You will be required to do this as
a participation assignment in the first week.

##### Exam Schedule for Math 5620

<hr>

Students are required to attend all exams on the days and times specified unless
a USU excused absence is involved. If you are not able to attend the exams, it
would be best to register for the course next semester. USU excused absences
and/or family emergencies must be related to the instructor before the exam date
and time.

##### USU Math 5620 Ordinary Differential Equations Course Description:

<hr>

The official USU catalog course description, as of fall 2023, is the
following:

> **MATH 5620 - Numerical Algorithms for Approximate Solutions of DE**
>
> 2 credit(s)
>
>Students solve initial value problems (IVP) and boundary value problems (BVP)
> in one dimension using standard methods. Topics include implicit and explicit
> methods, local and global error, stability, consistency and convergence,
> predictor-corrector methods and Runge-Kutta schemes, multi-step methods, and
> finite-difference methods for BVP.
>
> **Prerequisite(s):** MATH 4610, MATH 2250 or MATH 2280 with a C- or better
>
> **Repeatable for credit:** No
>
> **Grade Mode:** Standard

<hr>

##### Textbook Information:

<hr>

The textbook for the course is the following

<pre>
  Title: Finite Difference Methods for Ordinary and Partial Differential
         Equations
  Author: Randall J LeVeque 
  Edition: 1st
  Publisher: SIAM
  ISBN: 978-0-898716-29-0 
</pre>

In addition to the textbook, there may be a few documents dealing with course
material needed during the semester. These documents will be posted on the
Canvas/github page for the course or a link will be provided on the Canvas page
for the course. Also, if additional readings and documents are required, the
links and/or documents needed will be described during lectures.

A few remarks:

1. The codes in the textbook are written in Matlab. Students should be prepared
   to translate the matlab lines to C or Python. The easier language to
   translate the codes into is Python. 
2. Our goal will be to go through the textbook following the table of contents.
   At the end of 10 weeks we will be in a position to write code to solve a
   problem that is included in active research (e.q, weather forecasting models
   or mechanics of alloys).

##### Instructor Comments about the Course

<hr>

This course is intended for undergraduate students in science and engineering
programs. Most real world models of interest to engineers and scientists involve
the use of differential equations in a fundamental way. Physical problems like
fluid flow are best modeled through rates of change in the mass or volume at a
point in a domain, which in the limit, create derivatives. So, we will end up
with equations that involve the derivatives of unknown function or functions.

1. The course meets three days per week. We will be covering a lot of material
   in each and every class meeting.
2. Although role will not be taken, students are required to attend this course
   in the sense that lectures will not be repeated. Students are expected to
   attend all classes and participate in discussions during class time. Time
   will be taken in each lecture to answer questions about material previously
   presented and any questions about homework.
3. Students who are in need of accommodations should contact appropriate people 
   including your instructor to identify issues. For example, students in need
   of accommodations should contact the DRC on campus as soon as possible.
4. It is highly recommended that students take notes during class to keep up
   with the material presented and to keep up with the lectures.
5. Be on time! Most students in this course will take professional jobs that
   require an employee be on time to work, for meetings, or honoring deadlines.
   This course is no different.

If you have any questions about the course material, course policies, or any
other matters, please contact the instructor for the course via email, before
or after class, or during office hours.

##### Grading:

<hr>

Your grade in the course will be determined by the following:

1. Each student is required to meet with the instructor in the instructor's
   office during the first week of the semester and prior to exams described
   below during posted office hours or by making an appointment. Each required
   visit will count as one homework assignment. You can view this as a course
   participation assignment. You will be required to do this 3 times during the
   semester. Your instructor will give windows of time for each of the visit.
2. Homework will account for a 60% of a student's grade. Homework must be
   turned-in on time. Dates of submission will be determined in class.
3. Two midterms will be given. Each will cover about one half of the content of
   the course. Each of these midterms will account 40% of the
   grade earned in the course.

If students have questions about grading please contact your instructor. One of
the assignments will be to meet with your instructor at least twice during the
semester. Any concerns about the course can be expressed at these meetings.

##### Final Grade Scale:

<hr>

The final grade received in class will be determined using the following table:

| Normalized Total Score | Letter Grade |
| ---------------------: | :----------- |
| 94-100                 | A            |
| 90-94                  | A-           |
| 87-90                  | B+           |
| 83-87                  | B            |
| 80-83                  | B-           |
| 77-80                  | C+           |
| 70-87                  | C            |
| 67-70                  | D+           |
| 60-67                  | D            |
| 0-60                   | F            |

The final grade will be the best possible in the table above. So, if your total normalized points amounts to 79.98 the grade will be rounded up to 80 which according to the table will be B-
